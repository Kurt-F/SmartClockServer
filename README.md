# SmartClockServer
The server portion of our 4491 project

This is a django site created as part of a term project for a special topics class at KSU. Most files were automatically generated by PyCharm and django, with the code I wrote in the two app folders (accounts and alarms), static and templates. I used the existing django user system and an additional "Profile" table to add additional data to users. In the accounts app I implemented a signup page (using the existing django solution) and the rest of the functionality lives in the alarms app, including the API used to communicate with the physical clockand the various pages used to set and unset alarms.
